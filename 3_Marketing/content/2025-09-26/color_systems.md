# ðŸŽ¨ Behind the Scenes: Building Scalable Color Systems

Ever wondered how we create cohesive color palettes that work across all platforms? Here's a peek into our process:

## Our 5-Step Color System

1. **Primary Color Selection**
   - Start with your brand's core color
   - Ensure WCAG AA/AAA compliance
   - Test across devices and materials

2. **Creating Color Variations**
   - 9-step color scale (50-900)
   - Consistent saturation and brightness
   - Perfect for light/dark modes

3. **Accessibility First**
   - Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
   - Colorblind-friendly palettes
   - Text/background pairings

4. **Implementation**
   - CSS/SCSS variables
   - Design tokens
   - Documentation for developers

5. **Testing**
   - Multiple screen types
   - Print materials
   - Different lighting conditions

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Always name your colors semantically (e.g., `--primary-500`) instead of literally (e.g., `--blue-500`) for better maintainability.

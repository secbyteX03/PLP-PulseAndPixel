# Quick Tip: Use Contrast to Guide Attention

ðŸŽ¨ **The Power of Contrast in Design**

Contrast isn't just about colorsâ€”it's about creating visual hierarchy and guiding your audience's eye to what matters most. Here's how to use it effectively:

## 1. Color Contrast
- Use high contrast for CTAs (Call-to-Action)
- Dark text on light backgrounds (or vice versa) for readability
- Highlight key elements with accent colors

## 2. Size Contrast
- Make important elements larger
- Use varying font sizes for hierarchy
- Create visual weight with size differences

## 3. Space Contrast
- White space around important elements
- Group related items together
- Use padding to create breathing room

ðŸ“± **Example:** Notice how the "Sign Up" button stands out? That's contrast at work!

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Test your designs in grayscale first. If everything looks the same, you need more contrast!
